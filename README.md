For even better performance:
- If the snake/3D contrib grids still lag → temporarily comment them out with `<!-- -->` to test.
- For a **true animated holographic skull** (instead of static fallback), try one of these direct GIF links (pick one that loads best for you):
  - Purple glitch dissolve neon skull: https://media.giphy.com/media/some-cyber-skull-id/giphy.gif (search GIPHY "cyberpunk skull" for latest)
  - Or from StockCake animated variants if available.
- Your website (poostudio.github.io) might be minimal/empty right now — adding a simple 3D canvas (three.js skull hologram) there would make the "ENTER THE VOID" button way more immersive.

To pimp your **PFP** (profile picture) even more, here are some killer neon cyberpunk holographic skull options. Crop any to square 1:1, add glow in an editor if needed, and set as your GitHub/X avatar — it'll match the README perfectly.

Refresh GitHub after updating, clear cache if needed (Ctrl+F5), and it should go from 2% → full neon overload. If it's still stuck, drop a screenshot or tell me which part isn't loading — we'll debug it further. Reality warp initiated 💀🔮
